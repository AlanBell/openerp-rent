OpenERP Rent
============

The `OpenERP Rent`_ module let you rent products to your customers. It supports both *services* and *stockable* products.
OpenERP support many reporting engines, but we decided to use `Aeroo Report`_ because you will be able to easily modify
the generated report into *LibreOffice*.
