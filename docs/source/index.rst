OpenERP Rent
============

The `OpenERP Rent`_ module let you rent products to your customers. It supports both *service* and *stockable* products.
OpenERP supports many reporting engines, but we decided to use `Aeroo Report`_ so you can edit your report
directly inside *LibreOffice*.

Currently, OpenERP Rent is only compatible with OpenERP 6.0 (but should be ported to 6.1 as soon as possible).
